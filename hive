1. What is the difference between static and dynamic partitioning ?

   Static Partitioning :  Suitable for cases where you have limited and well known set of values.
                          You have to manually decide how many partitions the table will have, its the values for partitions
                          You have to make sure that you are loading right data into right partition while loading itself
                          By default, hive will disable dynamic partitioning
                          
    -- Source data is in the local file system, 
	  -- We are creating an external table pointing to an non-existing directory '/user/gasons/data/emp'
    -- While creating the partition table, please dont mention the partitioned column in the create table script
    -- Partitioned column should only be mentioned in the PARTITIONED BY clause

    -- Non Partitioned Table loading CSV data
    CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE employee (
     empno int,
     ename string,
     job string,
     mgr int,
     hiredate string,
     sal int,
     comm int,
     deptno int
    ) ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
     FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
     STORED AS TEXTFILE
     LOCATION '/user/gasons/data/emp'
     TBLPROPERTIES("skip.header.line.count"="1");

    -- Partitioned Table loading CSV data
    CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE employee_dept (
     empno int,
     ename string,
     job string,
     mgr int,
     hiredate string,
     sal int,
     comm int
    ) PARTITIONED BY (
     deptno int
    ) ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
     FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
     STORED AS TEXTFILE 
     LOCATION '/user/gasons/data/emp_part';


    -- Once the above table is created, load the data into the table from local file system
    -- Here while loading you should make sure, you are loading right data to right partition
    -- Even if you try to load other partitions data specifying different partition value, the system loads it as such
    -- This is the one drawback in static partitioning, also if you have to add partitions each time you load new data in it manually

    LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH '/home/gasons/Downloads/dinesh/DataSet/EmployeeDataSet/emp.csv' INTO TABLE employee_dept PARTITION (deptno=200);

    -- To add a new partition in a table, use
    ALTER TABLE employee_dept ADD IF NOT EXISTS PARTITION(deptno=10);

    ALTER TABLE employee_dept ADD IF NOT EXISTS PARTITION(deptno=10) LOCATION '/user/gasons/data/emp_part/deptno=10';

    -- Insert data into the above created partition 'deptno=10' from another table.
    -- Dont include the partition column in select list
    INSERT INTO employee_dept PARTIITION(deptno=10) SELECT empno, ename, job, mgr, hiredate, sal, comm FROM employee where deptno=10;

    -- Drop a partition
    ALTER TABLE employee_dept DROP IF EXISTS PARTITION(deptno=10)


    Static Partitioning : By Default hive dynamic partitioning is disabled. This is to protect us from creating huge number of partitions accidentally
                          You can enable dynamic Partitioning by the below commands
                          
    SET hive.exec.dynamic.partition=true;
    SET hive.exec.dynamic.partition.mode=nonstrict;
    
    -- Execute below command so that all the partitions will be created by its own and the data will be populated as well
    INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE employee_dept SELECT empno, ename, job, mgr, hiredate, sal, comm, deptno FROM employee;
