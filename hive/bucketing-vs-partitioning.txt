What is the difference between Partitioning and Bucketing?

  Partitioning helps to organize data in a logical fashion, by creating subdirectory per partition value.
  Partitioning helps to scan only respective data, rather than scanning entire data sets
  
  When partitioning creates large number of subdirectories, will create performance impact on Namenode.
  Also partitioning cannot help if there is data skews.
  In such scenarios bucketing can be used
  Bucketing helps to decompose data sets in a more managable way.
  Basically if the partition feild have high cardinality then just use bucketing on that field.
  
  CREATE TABLE mytable ( 
         name string,
         city string,
         employee_id int ) 
PARTITIONED BY (year STRING, month STRING, day STRING) 
CLUSTERED BY (employee_id) INTO 256 BUCKETS.

-- this will create a directory structure as '/user/hive/warehouse/mytable/y=2015/m=12/d=02'
-- further there would be 256 files under day folder

-- Another example
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE employee_buck (
 empno int,
 ename string,
 job string,
 mgr int,
 hiredate string,
 sal int,
 comm int
) PARTITIONED BY (
 deptno int
) CLUSTERED BY (
 job
) INTO 3 buckets 
 ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
 FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
 STORED AS TEXTFILE 
 LOCATION '/user/gasons/data/emp_buck';

SET hive.exec.dynamic.partition.mode=nonstrict;
SET hive.exec.dynamic.partition=true;

INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE employee_buck PARTITION(deptno) SELECT empno, ename, job, mgr, hiredate, sal, comm, deptno FROM employee;
